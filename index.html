                            <strong>The unemployment rate</strong> is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force. During periods of recession, an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate.[1] According to International Labour Organization report, more than 200 million people globally or 6% of the world's workforce were without a job in 2012.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                Taxes can eat from <strong>0%</strong>, when properly managed up to <strong>~85%</strong> of your profit when missmanaged.
                For an individual investor there are three applicable taxes which we will discuss in detail later on:

                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withholding_tax">Witholding tax</a>: in most jurisdictions the country in which <strong>the company</strong> is domiciled in, witholds a tax upon <strong>distribution of dividends</strong> of said company to it's shareholders. It's shareholders may be you as an individual investor or in a more complicated case: a managment company (In the case of ETF's and Index Funds. More on that later)</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax">Payroll tax</a>: In edge cases dividends and capital gains may be taxed as normal income</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax">Capital gains tax</a>: this is the tax imposed upon the amount won when selling an equity with a profit </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Investor Tax Residence</h3>

                In order to understand who and how taxes work, we will look at who and how owns an ETF in a complicated scenario.

                <p>
                    Meet Max:<img class = "icon" src = "icons/max.png"></img>.
                    Max used to live in slovakia his whole life and be a tax resident there:
                    <a href = "http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/slovakia/index_en.htm" class = "icon-group">
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/slovakia.png"></img>
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/max.png"></img>
                    </a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    But he started working in Germany and spends 7 months of the year there. According to
                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_residence#Tax_residence_in_Germany">German Tax Residence Law</a> Max is considered a Tax Resident of Germany now:
                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_residence#Tax_residence_in_Germany" class = "icon-group">
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/germany.png"></img>
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/max.png"></img>
                    </a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Germany defines the breakpoint at 6 months and because Max reaches it, he pays taxes (Income, Dividend and Capital gains) to the German Govornment:
                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Germany" class = "icon-group">
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/germany.png"></img>
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/govornment.png"></img>
                    </a>
                </p>

                <p>
                Because he is resident in Slovakia for less then 183 calendar days, he is <strong>not</strong> layable to pay any taxes there, <a href = "http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/slovakia/index_en.htm">according to the Slovak tax law </a>.
                </p>

                <p>In theory he could fall in two Govornment jurisdictions, although for that to be possible both govornments should have a small enough breakpoint for Max to be defined as a tax resident in both</p>

                <h3>Brokers</h3>

                <p>
                    Max doesn't like German and Slovak brokers. He uses a Belgian one:
                    <a href = "" class = "icon-group">
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/belgium.png"></img>
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/broker.png"></img>
                    </a>
                 </p>

                 <p>
                     Every time he recieves a dividend payment he has to pay
                     <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_rate_withholding_tax_%28Abgeltungsteuer%29">the dividend tax rate of the country of his residence (25%)</a>
                     to the govornment of said country:
                     <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Germany" class = "icon-group">
                         <img class = "icon" src = "icons/germany.png"></img>
                         <img class = "icon" src = "icons/govornment.png"></img>
                     </a>.

                     His brocker being in Belgium has no effect on his rate. It does have an effect on <strong>who</strong> is responsible for that collection. If he had used a
                     German broker, the broker would automatically collect the tax and send it to the German authorities. Now he has to do that himself, by submiting country speficif formulars.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whetever a company decides to pay out dividends, it collects
                    a percentage of the dividends as a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_tax">dividend tax</a>.


                    in accordance to the tax rate of the <strong> company's tax residence country </strong> and <strong>the beneficiary tax residence</strong>
                    in behalf of
                    <strong>the govornment the company is a tax resident in</strong>.
                <p>

                <p>
                    Let's take an example. Let's say Shell decides to pay 1€ worth of dividends to Max.
                    Because Max has registered as a German citizen when opening his Belgian account, his broker knows his tax residence and transmits that
                    information to the dutch govornment.

                    The Dutch govornment now witholds 15% tax.

                    As an example, Shell pays 1€ in dividend to Max, through his broker which let's the dutch Govornment know Max is a resident of Germany:

                    Because the Belgium brokerage has no authority to withold any taxes of non-Belgian tax residents(neither should it),
                    it just passes the sum to Max.

                <h3>Double taxation treaties</h3>

                <p>

                    Now Max has to pay the govornment his 25% share. But Germany has a signed treaty with the netherlands
                    <a href = "http://download.belastingdienst.nl/belastingdienst/docs/verdragsstaten_ib_niet_ingezetenen_ib4011z2fd.pdf" class = "icon-group">But Germany has a signed treaty with the netherlands</a>
                    in order to avoid double taxation.

                    Because of that the German govornment recognizes the 15% that Max paid, and demands only the 10% left to add to it's own tax
                    rate of 25%. In fact Germany always recognizes 15%, and in theory has a treaty with many nations, where an agreement is riched that the
                    foreign nation should tax dividends up to 15%, so that the rest of the tax is owed to the German govornment (25 - 15)%.
