                <p>
                    Germany defines the breakpoint at 6 months and because Max reaches it, he pays taxes (Income, Dividend and Capital gains) to the German Govornment:
                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Germany" class = "icon-group">
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/germany.png"></img>
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/govornment.png"></img>
                    </a>
                </p>

                <p>
                Because he is resident in Slovakia for less then 183 calendar days, he is <strong>not</strong> layable to pay any taxes there, <a href = "http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/slovakia/index_en.htm">according to the Slovak tax law </a>.
                </p>

                <p>In theory he could fall in two Govornment jurisdictions, although for that to be possible both govornments should have a small enough breakpoint for Max to be defined as a tax resident in both</p>

                <h3>Brokers</h3>

                <p>
                    Max doesn't like German and Slovak brokers. He uses a Belgian one:
                    <a href = "" class = "icon-group">
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/belgium.png"></img>
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/broker.png"></img>
                    </a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every time he recieves a dividend payment he has to pay
                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_rate_withholding_tax_%28Abgeltungsteuer%29">the dividend tax rate of the country of his residence (25%)</a>
                    to the govornment of said country:
                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Germany" class = "icon-group">
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/germany.png"></img>
                        <img class = "icon" src = "icons/govornment.png"></img>
                    </a>.

                    His brocker being in Belgium has no effect on his rate. It does have an effect on <strong>who</strong> is responsible for that collection. If he had used a
                    German broker, the broker would automatically collect the tax and send it to the German authorities. Now he has to do that himself, by submiting country speficif formulars.

                <p>
                    Whetever a company decides to pay out dividends, it collects
                    a percentage of the dividends as a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_tax">dividend tax</a>.


                    in accordance to the tax rate of the <strong> company's tax residence country </strong> and <strong>the beneficiary tax residence</strong>
                    in behalf of
                    <strong>the govornment the company is a tax resident in</strong>.
                <p>

                <p>
                    Let's take an example. Let's say Shell decides to pay 1€ worth of dividends to Max.
                    Because Max has registered as a German citizen when opening his Belgian account, his broker knows his tax residence and transmits that
                    information to the dutch govornment.

                    The Dutch govornment now witholds 15% tax.

                    As an example, Shell pays 1€ in dividend to Max, through his broker which let's the dutch Govornment know Max is a resident of Germany:

                    <witholding-chain participants = "netherlands:shell,
                                                      netherlands:govornment(0.15),
                                                      belgium:broker(0.00)
                                                      "></witholding-chain>

                    Because the Belgium brokerage has no authority to withold any taxes of non-Belgian tax residents(neither should it),
                    it just passes the sum to Max:

                    <witholding-chain capital = '0.85' participants = "belgium:broker(0.00),
                                                      germany:max
                                                      "></witholding-chain>

                </p>

                <h3>Double taxation treaties</h3>

                <p>

                    Now Max has to pay the govornment his 25% share.
                    <a href = "http://download.belastingdienst.nl/belastingdienst/docs/verdragsstaten_ib_niet_ingezetenen_ib4011z2fd.pdf">But Germany has a signed treaty with the netherlands</a>
                    in order to avoid double taxation.

                    Because of that the German govornment recognizes the 15% that Max paid, and demands only the 10% left to add to it's own tax
                    rate of 25%. In fact Germany always recognizes 15%, and in theory has a treaty with many nations, where an agreement is riched that the
                    foreign nation should tax dividends up to 15%, so that the rest of the tax is owed to the German govornment (25 - 15)%.

                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "germany:max(0.75),
                                                      germany:govornment
                                                      "></witholding-chain>


                    So we end up with the following chain:

                    <witholding-chain participants = "netherlands:shell,
                                                      netherlands:govornment(0.15),
                                                      belgium:broker(0.00),
                                                      germany:max(0.75),
                                                      germany:govornment(all)
                                                      "></witholding-chain>
                </p>

                <h3>Examples from across Europe</h3>

                <p>
                    Max invests in Nestle (incorporated in Switzerland):

                    <witholding-chain participants = "switzerland:company,
                                                      switzerland:govornment(0.15),
                                                      belgium:broker(0.00),
                                                      germany:max(0.75),
                                                      germany:govornment(all)
                                                      "></witholding-chain>
                    And while in theory it should work that way, the Swiss govornment automatically witholds its normal 35%. You can
                    submit a form in a lenghty process to get the 0.20€ (35 - 15)% the Swiss owe you in a lenghty process.
                </p>

                <h2>ETF Dividends Tax</h2>

                <p>
                    By buying an ETF an investor buys a share of a <strong>legal entity</strong> (different then a share of a company in most cases) which itself
                    owns shares in companies and recieves dividends by them. The ETF then distributes(or not. some on that later) the dividends to the investors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By ETF's a new very important variable enters the game: The ETF domicile. This domicile has 2 effects on our examples.
                    Fortunately almost all of the European ETFs are domiciled in either France, Luxembourg or Ireland which makes the picture
                    somewhat easier.
                </p>

                <h3>ETF Domicile: company witholding tax</h3>

                <p>
                    For the purpouses of the witholding tax, the Govornment of the company the ETF holds witholds tax as if it was witholding tax from a resident of
                    the country the ETF is domiciled in.
                    </p>

                    By distribution of dividends, the Swiss govornment trheats the Irish ETF as

                    (which put's the maximum witholding tax at 15% instead of the 35% without a treaty).

                    The same thing happens in the Netherlands, but the treaty there doesn't help the ETF case since, the non-treaty tax-rate is still 15%:

                <p>
                    Remember when we said that the ETF is a misterious "Legal Entity"? Well that misterious entity has a special
                    status in Ireland and Luxembourg, making the respective countries withold 0% tax rate. The only other popular option for Europe:
                    France makes no such distinctions and treats it like a normal company.

                    A few examples:

                    Note that to the point of view of the French govornment,
                    the fund is a normal company distributing dividends and therefore 25% is taxed on top of those
                    dividends (0.85€) and not the original value.

                <p>

                    An example of the french govornment treating funds as if they are normal companies, but taxing only 15 % because <strong>the investor is a tax resident in switzerland</strong>

                     takes the rest (35 - 15) = 20% of the 0.85 euro left. (Because Switzerland has a 35% dividend tax rate)

                    Because the fund is treated from the outside as a normal luxembourgian company, and Australia has no treaty the Australian govornment, it taxes him the full 30% (on the 0.70 euro profit).

                <h3>Distributing versus Capitalizing / Accumulating dividends</h3>

                <p>
                    So far all of the examples shown were those with distributing dividends. So how are accumulating dividends different?
                    Funds accumulating dividends just don't distribute the dividends to the investor but reinvest it in the company:

                    <witholding-chain participants = "netherlands:company,
                                                      netherlands:govornment(0.15),
                                                      ireland:fund(0.00),
                                                      ireland:govornment(0.00),
                                                      netherlands:company(all)
                                                      "></witholding-chain>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Meanwhile the investor doesn't get any dividends. He just sees his fund growing in value (by all of the dividends):

                    <witholding-chain participants = "netherlands:company,
                                                      netherlands:govornment(0.15),
                                                      ireland:fund(all),
                                                      ireland:govornment(0.00),
                                                      netherlands:company(all),
                                                      germany:max(all),
                                                      germany:govornment(all)
                                                      "></witholding-chain>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In theory he avoids the 25% German tax. In practice many govornments still make him pay the tax on the redistributed dividends, out of
                    his pocket:

                    <witholding-chain participants = "netherlands:company,
                                                      netherlands:govornment(0.15),
                                                      ireland:fund(all),
                                                      ireland:govornment(0.00),
                                                      netherlands:company(all),
                                                      germany:max(-0.21),
                                                      germany:govornment(all)
                                                      "></witholding-chain>

                    So  the investor is left with
                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "ireland:fund(all)" style = "display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0"></witholding-chain> +
                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "germany:max(-0.21)" style = "display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0"></witholding-chain>
                    =
                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.64" participants = "germany:max(0.64)" style = "display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0"></witholding-chain>
                    worth of profit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But there is a caveat. Let's assume the ETF has no natural growth for this example. All the growth comes from reinvesting of dividends.
                    The ETF grew by
                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "ireland:fund(all)" style = "display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0"></witholding-chain>. At some point max

                    will want to sell the ETF (since the ETF is not distributing the dividends, that's his only way of making a profit).

                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax#Germany">A capital gains tax of 25%</a> will be witheld from Max because he made a profit.

                    So when he sells Max is left with:
                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "ireland:fund(0.00), germany:govornment(0.21), germany:max(all)"></witholding-chain>

                    But remember he paid 0.21 already in dividend tax from his pocket:
                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "germany:max(0.64)" style = "display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0"></witholding-chain> +
                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "germany:max(-0.21)" style = "display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0"></witholding-chain>
                    =
                    <witholding-chain capital = "0.64" participants = "germany:max(0.43)" style = "display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0"></witholding-chain>
                </p>

                <h3>When capitalizing dividends makes sense</h3>

                <p>
                    Capitalizing the dividends would make sense if:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The tax payer country has no dividend tax on capitalized dividends (so Max wouldn't have to pay out of his pocket)</li>
                        <li>The capital gains tax is smaller then the dividend tax (of the taxpayer country)</li>
                        <li>The tax payer is in a no dividend tax on capitalized dividends country and plans to move to a country with lower capital gains tax.
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    An example: Max, a Bulgarian investor has an accumulating fund. In Bulgaria, <a href = "http://www.minfin.bg/bg/page/789">you pay tax only on dividends passed down to you</a>, so he pays 0% dividend tax for the time
                    being:

                    <witholding-chain participants = "netherlands:company,
                                                      netherlands:govornment(0.15),
                                                      ireland:fund(all),
                                                      ireland:govornment(0.00),
                                                      bulgaria:max(all),
                                                      bulgaria:govornment(all)
                                                      "></witholding-chain>

                  Were max to sell his shares, he would have to pay the 5% capital gains tax on his accumulation:

                  <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "ireland:fund(0.00),
                                                    ireland:govornment(0.00),
                                                    bulgaria:govornment(0.04),
                                                    bulgaria:max(all)
                                                    "></witholding-chain>

                  But if first Max decided to move to Slovakia, wait the time needed to be a tax residend there, and not
                  be a tax resident in Bulgaria anymore (usually around ~6 months), he would have to pay capital gains taxses
                  to the Slovak govornment, which is 0%:

                  <witholding-chain capital = "0.85" participants = "ireland:fund(0.00),
                                                    ireland:govornment(0.00),
                                                    slovakia:govornment(0.00),
                                                    bulgaria:max(all)
                                                    "></witholding-chain>
